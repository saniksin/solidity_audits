# Solidity Audit Portfolio

Welcome to my audit portfolio repository. This repository showcases my work as a Solidity developer and smart contract auditor. Here, you will find both educational examples and real-world audits that demonstrate my skills in ensuring the security and robustness of blockchain projects.

## About Me

My name is Saniksin, and I am a Solidity developer with a passion for blockchain security. I specialize in auditing smart contracts to identify vulnerabilities and recommend best practices. With a background in software engineering and an ongoing focus on Solidity, I have developed strong expertise in analyzing smart contract code and contributing to a safer blockchain ecosystem.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio to present my work in smart contract auditing. It includes:

1. **Educational Audits**: These are reports created as part of my learning process. They serve to showcase my understanding of smart contract security and highlight different auditing methodologies I have explored.
2. **Real-World Audits**: Actual audit reports from real blockchain projects that I have been involved with. These demonstrate my experience in working with real clients and my ability to identify and address vulnerabilities in live environments.

I aim to provide transparency in my auditing approach, documenting vulnerabilities, potential risks, and recommended mitigations for each audited smart contract.

## How to Use This Repository

- **For Recruiters and Collaborators**: Feel free to explore both the educational and real-world audit reports to assess my skills and experience in smart contract auditing.
- **For Developers and Learners**: The educational audits are also a learning resource. They are designed to help others understand common vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them effectively.
