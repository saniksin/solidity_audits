# Education Directory - Solidity Smart Contract Audits

This directory contains educational audits that I completed as part of my training through the **Cyfrin Updraft** program. The program, available at [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft), provided hands-on experience with smart contract auditing, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities, understanding best practices, and improving the overall security of Solidity codebases.

## About This Directory

The **education** folder includes a series of smart contract audits that I conducted as a student. Each report serves as a demonstration of my growth as an auditor, covering a range of vulnerabilities and offering mitigation strategies. These audits represent both my learning process and the progression of my skills in blockchain security.

### Contents

- **Markdown Reports**: The **md/** folder contains Markdown versions of the audit reports, which are easy to edit and collaborate on.
- **PDF Reports**: The **pdf/** folder includes finalized PDF versions of each audit, which are useful for presenting or sharing.

## Learning Focus

The audits in this directory aim to showcase my understanding of the following:
- **Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, improper access control, etc.
- **Best Practices**: Following security standards and using the latest Solidity features for safer contracts.
- **Hands-On Auditing Experience**: The practical skills gained from auditing real-world inspired contracts, improving my ability to analyze and secure blockchain systems.

These educational audits are meant to be a resource not only for myself but for others looking to improve their own auditing skills by learning from examples.

## Cyfrin Updraft Program

**Cyfrin Updraft** is a well-regarded program that provides in-depth training in smart contract security and auditing. Through this program, I gained practical experience by auditing various Solidity contracts and learned advanced techniques to secure blockchain projects effectively. You can learn more about the program [here](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft).
